He is a critical thinker and understands how to analyze a problem, and convert that problem into a tangible requirements doc. He also understands how to take a data driven approach to tackle features and initiatives. Most importantly, he is a quick and humble learner that loves researching the areas of the business that are new to him. I highly recommend Naren for any product, business analyst, or data analyst roles.",
